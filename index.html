     <h2>My first repository on a GitHub
     <p>I'm best known as someone who <em> gets along with anyone</em>
      Learning about technology is one of the most fun thing which I usually like to do
      in my free time because that is one thing which keeps changing everyday. For example, there is always new things which we are
      required to have a knowldege about whether in school or by searchig it about online. 
      <strong> this is my first time using GitHUb, I had no idea about it before taking this class, I am glad I took this class 
      because I relaized GitHub is something from which I can get to learn about so many different kinds of things which I do not
      know about yet. 
      For example, I can use it for my future projects and many more things which can help me a lot. 
      There ar not only one things for which we can use GitHub for but many other things too.
